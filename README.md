# 🍔 The Burger Lab | Dynamic Restaurant Homepage

Welcome to **The Burger Lab**, a dynamic restaurant homepage project built entirely with JavaScript! This project demonstrates the use of DOM manipulation techniques to dynamically generate a responsive, interactive website without any hardcoded HTML content (except for the `<div id="content">`).

## 🌟 Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to practice and showcase JavaScript skills by dynamically rendering the entire contents of a multi-page restaurant website. The website includes the following pages:

- **🏠 Home:** Introduces the restaurant and its mission.
- **📋 Menu:** Showcases a selection of curated burgers with unique descriptions and images.
- **👨‍🍳 About Us:** Shares the story, philosophy, and core values of the restaurant.

### ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Rendering:** All content, including navigation buttons, page layouts, and content sections, is generated via JavaScript.
- **Reusable Code:** Modular functions are used to render different sections of the website.
- **Interactive Navigation:** Navigation buttons allow users to switch between pages seamlessly.
- **CSS Styling:** The project uses modern CSS for layout and design, including grid and flexbox techniques for responsiveness.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **JavaScript:** For DOM manipulation and event handling.
- **HTML (Template):** Provides a minimal skeleton (`<div id="content">`) for dynamic rendering.
- **CSS:** Adds style and layout to the dynamically generated elements.
- **Webpack:** Used for bundling and module management.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

This project was developed to:

1. Gain proficiency in JavaScript DOM manipulation.
2. Practice structuring code using reusable functions and modules.
3. Explore dynamic page rendering without hardcoding content into HTML files.
